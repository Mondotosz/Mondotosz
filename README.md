## About me
I'm a second year IT specialist apprentice at [CPNV](https://www.cpnv.ch/).
I don't have many projects done yet as I still need to learn the basics, but it'll come with time. I'm currently interested in web development which will be a majority of the courses I'll be undertaking during this year.
